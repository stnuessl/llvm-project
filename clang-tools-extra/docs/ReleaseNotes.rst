New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

- New :doc:`autosar-interface-connected
  <clang-tidy/checks/autosar/interface-connected>` check.

  Checks automatically generated AUTOSAR interfaces and emits appropriate
  diagnostics if unconnected interfaces are detected.

- New :doc:`autosar-memory-mapping
  <clang-tidy/checks/autosar/memory-mapping>` check.

  Detects multiple potential issues with regards to the AUTOSAR memory mapping
  specification including unmapped or wrongly mapped variables and functions.

- New :doc:`autosar-type-usage
  <clang-tidy/checks/autosar/type-usage>` check.

  Detects issues with regards to AUTOSAR types and their associated macro values
  by essentially treating these types as enumerations.

- New :doc:`embedded-default-case-position
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/default-case-position>` check.

  Detects default statements within switch statements that are not located at
  the first or last position in the case list.

- New :doc:`embedded-missing-compound
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/missing-compound>` check.

  Detects `do`, `for`, `while`, `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements where the
  body is not a compound statement.

- New :doc:`embedded-missing-else
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/missing-else>` check.

  Detects `if` ... `else if` constructs that lack a terminating `else`
  statement. This pattern may be interpreted similarly to a `switch`
  statement without a `default` case.

- New :doc:`embedded-missing-static
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/missing-static>` check.

  Detects inline function declarations that lack the static storage qualifier.

- New :doc:`embedded-no-comma-operator
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/no-comma-operator>` check.

  Detects usage of the comma operator, which is considered bad practice
  according to coding standards like `MISRA C <https://misra.org.uk>`_.

- New :doc:`embedded-no-early-return
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/no-early-return>` check.

  Detects early return statements that are not placed at the end of
  a function bodyâ€™s compound statement.

- New :doc:`embedded-no-flexible-array-member
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/no-flexible-array-member>` check.

  Detects flexible array member declarations.

- New :doc:`embedded-no-partial-array-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/no-partial-array-init>` check.

  Detects partial array initializiations.

- New :doc:`embedded-no-stdarg-features
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/no-stdarg-features>` check.

  Detects usage of types and macros from `stdarg.h`.

- New :doc:`embedded-no-union
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/no-union>` check.

  Detects union declarations, which are considered bad practice according to
  coding standards like `MISRA C <https://misra.org.uk>`_.

- New :doc:`embedded-no-variable-length-array
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/no-variable-length-array>` check.

  Detects declarations of variable length arrays.
