New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

- New :doc:`autosar-interface-connected
  <clang-tidy/checks/autosar/interface-connected>` check.

  Checks automatically generated AUTOSAR interfaces and emits appropriate
  diagnostics if unconnected interfaces are detected.

- New :doc:`autosar-memory-mapping
  <clang-tidy/checks/autosar/memory-mapping>` check.

  Detects multiple potential issues with regards to the AUTOSAR memory mapping
  specification including unmapped or wrongly mapped variables and functions.

- New :doc:`autosar-type-usage
  <clang-tidy/checks/autosar/type-usage>` check.

  Detects issues with regards to AUTOSAR types and their associated macro values
  by essentially treating these types as enumerations.

- New :doc:`embedded-missing-else
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/missing-else>` check.

  Detects `if` ... `else if` constructs that lack a terminating `else`
  statement. This pattern may be interpreted similarly to a `switch`
  statement without a `default` case.

- New :doc:`embedded-no-early-return
  <clang-tidy/checks/embedded/no-early-return>` check.

  Detects early return statements that are not placed at the end of
  a function bodyâ€™s compound statement.
